# RealmSharper & RealmAspNet
RealmSharper is a RealmEye scraper primarily designed to scrape player information from RealmEye. In the future, I hope to have it scrape data from other pages (like a guild page, the RealmEye Wiki, Current Offers, Leaderboards, and more).

RealmAspNet is an ASP.NET API application that utilizes RealmSharper. Additionally, RealmAspNet has several additional utility features that are quite useful, such as the ability to parse a /who screenshot.

If demand arises, I will make RealmSharper into its own library.
