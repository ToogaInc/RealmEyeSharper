# RealmSharper & RealmAspNet
RealmSharper is a RealmEye scraper primarily designed to scrape player information from RealmEye. In the future, I hope to have it scrape data from other pages (like a guild page, the RealmEye Wiki, Current Offers, Leaderboards, and more).

RealmAspNet is an ASP.NET API application that utilizes RealmSharper. Additionally, RealmAspNet has several additional utility features that are quite useful.
